            A key objective is engaging digital marketing customers and allowing
            them to interact with the brand through servicing and delivery of
            digital media. Information is easy to access at a fast rate through
            the use of digital communications. Users with access to the Internet
            can use many digital mediums, such as Facebook, YouTube, Forums, and
            Email etc. Through Digital communications it creates a
            Multi-communication channel where information can be quickly
            exchanged around the world by anyone without any regard to whom they
            are.[28] Social segregation plays no part through social mediums due
            to lack of face to face communication and information being wide
            spread instead to a selective audience.{" "}
